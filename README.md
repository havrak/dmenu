# Havrak's dmenu

Extra stuff added to vanilla dmenu:

- can view color characters like emoji
- dmenu options are mouse clickable
- `-P` for password mode: hide user input
- `-r` to reject non-matching input
- `-x` to set x offset of the window
- `-y` to set y offset of the window

Removed stuff from vanilla dmenu:

- Xinerama support since it is unnecessary

## Installation

After making any config changes that you want, but `make`, `sudo make install` it.
